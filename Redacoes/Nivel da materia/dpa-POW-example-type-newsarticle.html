                           <span class="dateline">Johannesburg <span class="credit">(dpa)</span> - </span>At least 10 people were killed in a shooting and minibus crash in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province on Tuesday, the African News Agency reported.</p>
                        <p>The deputy chief of a minibus taxi association and four of his bodyguards were shot dead in their car by unidentified gunmen at an intersection, police said.</p>
                        <p>Having been shot, the driver of that vehicle lost control of the car and ploughed into a taxi full of teachers, five of whom were also killed, ANA reported.</p>
                        <p>The police suspect the shooting was a hit on the taxi boss by rivals.</p>
                        <p>Privately run minibuses are one of the most popular forms of transport in South Africa, and competition for the most lucrative routes is steep. </p>
